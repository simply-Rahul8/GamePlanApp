# GamePlanApp

Overview
The GamePlan App is a gamified fitness application designed to motivate users through real-time GPS check-ins and task tracking, built with React Native, Node.js, Spring Boot, and Firebase. As Team Lead of a 5-person team, I spearheaded the development, integrating SQL-based Flask APIs for efficient data management and deploying the app on Azure to support over 500 users. The app processes user-generated text (e.g., task descriptions, feedback) using NLP techniques like text preprocessing and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to provide personalized insights, such as summarizing user feedback. Interactive visualizations display user progress, enhancing engagement. This project showcases my expertise in full-stack development, NLP, and scalable deployment, aligning with applications like real-time user interaction analysis and fraud detection.
Features

Real-Time Task Tracking: Uses GPS check-ins to log fitness tasks, synced via Firebase for seamless updates.

Scalable Backend: Leverages Spring Boot and SQL-based Flask APIs for robust data management, deployed on Azure.
Team Leadership: Managed a 5-person team to deliver a user-centric, production-ready app.

Code Snippets
Text Preprocessing (Tokenization with NLTK)
This snippet preprocesses user feedback text from task descriptions using NLTK for tokenization, preparing it for sentiment analysis or RAG.
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Tokenize and clean text
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    stop_words = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalnum() and token not in stop_words]
    return tokens

# Example usage
feedback = "The running task was challenging but rewarding!"
tokens = preprocess_text(feedback)
print(tokens)  # Output: ['running', 'task', 'challenging', 'rewarding']

RAG Pipeline (LangChain Query)
This snippet implements a RAG pipeline to query user feedback stored in the database, using LangChain and OpenAI API for personalized insights.
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
import pandas as pd

def setup_rag_pipeline(feedback_data):
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(feedback_data['feedback'].tolist(), embeddings)
    llm = OpenAI(api_key='your_key_here')
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=vector_store.as_retriever())
    return qa_chain

# Example usage
feedback_data = pd.DataFrame({'feedback': ["Great workout!", "Tough but fun"]})
qa_chain = setup_rag_pipeline(feedback_data)
query = "Summarize positive user feedback."
response = qa_chain.run(query)
print(response)  # Output: Users found workouts great and fun.

Visualization (Chart.js in React Native)
This snippet generates a line chart for user task completion trends using Chart.js within the React Native app.
import React from 'react';
import { LineChart } from 'react-native-chart-kit';
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const TaskProgressChart = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <LineChart
      data={{
        labels: data.dates,
        datasets: [{ data: data.completions }],
      }}
      width={Dimensions.get('window').width - 20}
      height={220}
      chartConfig={{
        backgroundColor: '#e26a00',
        backgroundGradientFrom: '#fb8c00',
        backgroundGradientTo: '#ffa726',
        decimalPlaces: 0,
        color: (opacity = 1) => `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${opacity})`,
      }}
      bezier
    />
  );
};

// Example usage
const chartData = {
  dates: ['2025-06-01', '2025-06-02', '2025-06-03'],
  completions: [5, 7, 4],
};
<TaskProgressChart data={chartData} />;
